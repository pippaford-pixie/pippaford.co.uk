			body: [
				'I trained as a dramatherapist because I kept meeting people for whom talking alone was not enough. Some had no words yet for what had happened to them. Others had told their story so many times it had gone flat, rehearsed, held at arm’s length. The creative arts therapies offer another route in — through image, metaphor, movement, story and play — and often reach what conversation cannot.',
				'Since qualifying I have worked across a range of settings: with adults, with children in primary and secondary schools, and with young people who were struggling with something they could not yet put into words. That breadth has taught me that there is no single correct way to do this work. What helps one person feel safe enough to begin can feel intrusive to the next.'

				'I do not arrive with a fixed programme. We begin by finding out what you are hoping for, what has already been tried, and what pace feels manageable. From there I draw on whichever approaches seem to fit — and I will say plainly when I think something else, or someone else, would serve you better.',
				'My training is integrative rather than single-model: psychodynamic and humanistic foundations, Jungian and Internal Family Systems perspectives, somatic and nervous-system work, yoga and mindfulness therapy, EMDR, and now eco-depth practice. What that means for you is that a session can move between talking, noticing what is happening in your body, working with an image or an object, and structured work on a specific memory, depending on what is needed that day.',
				'What stays constant is the relationship. Work that goes below the surface of a problem asks something of you, and it is the quality of the relationship between us — not the technique — that makes that possible.'

The living world lends us metaphor: things lying dormant, weather passing through, ground that holds. Those images give shape to experiences that are hard to say straight out.',
				'I draw on the Natural Self Eco-Therapy model developed by the Natural Academy, which brings together person-centred therapy, Internal Family Systems and nature-based practice.

The tension that never quite lets go, the startle response that fires at nothing, the tiredness that sleep does not touch, the sense of being braced against something that stopped happening years ago.',
				'Somatic work goes at that directly. It means slowing right down and noticing what is actually happening — tightness, temperature, restlessness, the urge to move or to get out of the room — and treating all of that as information rather than background noise. Much of the time we are working with your nervous system: how quickly it tips into alarm, and what genuinely helps it settle again.',
				'This is where my yoga and mindfulness therapy training comes in, though I should say plainly that it is not a yoga class. It is closer to getting to know the particular signals your own body sends, and building a bit of capacity to shift them, so that a strong feeling becomes something you can stay present to instead of something that takes you over.',

				'Ask it that way round and a great deal of what looks like a problem turns out to be an adaptation. Hypervigilance made sense somewhere. Shutting down made sense somewhere. Finding it hard to trust a therapist makes complete sense if trusting people has gone badly before. So the work is not to strip those things out. It is to understand what they were for, and then to work out together whether you still need them.',
				'In practice that means a few things. You keep choice and control over the pace and the direction, because losing both is so often part of what happened in the first place. I will tell you what I am suggesting and why, rather than doing something to you. And we build enough steadiness before going anywhere near the hard material — because telling the story is not automatically healing. It can retraumatise, and I would rather say that plainly than pretend otherwise.',

				'EMDR — Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing — is a structured therapy developed specifically for traumatic memory. It is recommended by NICE for post-traumatic stress disorder in adults, and it is among the more thoroughly researched trauma treatments available.',
				'The working idea is that some memories never get processed and filed away in the ordinary manner. They stay raw and current, so that remembering feels less like recalling something that is over and more like living through it again. EMDR appears to help the brain finish that processing, so the memory becomes something that happened rather than something still happening.',
				'In a session you bring the memory to mind while following a repeated left-right movement or sound, in short sets, pausing after each one to notice whatever has shifted. It is a strange procedure to describe and considerably less strange to do. You stay in control throughout, you are not hypnotised, and you do not have to narrate the memory in detail — which is a relief to most people who ask.',
				'EMDR is not a quick fix and it is not the right starting point for everyone. It follows a defined protocol that begins with preparation and stabilisation, and we do not move to processing until there is enough steadiness to make that safe.

				'Sitting face to face can be confronting, particularly if you find eye contact hard or you are approaching something you feel ashamed of. Walking side by side, or holding something while you speak, tends to make the words come more easily. The body settles in the presence of trees, water and open ground, which does a lot of the nervous-system work described under somatic approaches. And the living world lends us its own images — the seasons turning, weather passing through, things rotting down and growing back — which give shape to experiences that resist being said straight out.',
